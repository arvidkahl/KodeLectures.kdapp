# Visit [firepad.io](http://www.firepad.io/) for demo, examples, and embedding docs!
Read on if you'd like to contribute to Firepad.

## Setting Up Your Environment
Firepad uses [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate some build tasks (generating / minifying firepad.js, etc.).
So before you get started, you'll need [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.  Then you can simply clone 
the repo, install the necessary node modules, and run grunt:

    git clone https://github.com/firebase/firepad.git
    cd firepad
    npm install
    sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
    grunt

## Source Code
To get started, here are some highlights of the directory structure and notable source files:

* `build/` - output directory for all files generated by grunt (firepad.js, firepad-min.js, firepad.zip, etc.).
* `examples` - examples of embedding Firepad.
* `lib/`
    * `firepad.js` - Entry point for Firepad.
    * `text-operation.js`, `client.js` - Heart of the Operation Transformation implementation.  Based on
      [ot.js](https://github.com/Operational-Transformation/ot.js/) but extended to allow arbitrary
      attributes on text (for representing rich-text).
    * `annotation-list.js` - A data model for representing annotations on text (i.e. spans of text with a particular
      set of attributes).
    * `rich-text-codemirror.js` - Uses AnnotationList to track annotations on the text and maintain the appropriate
      set of markers on a CodeMirror instance.
    * `firebase-adapter.js` - handles integration with Firebase (appending operations, triggering retries,
      presence, etc.).
* `test/` - Jasmine tests for Firepad (many of these were borrowed from ot.js).
